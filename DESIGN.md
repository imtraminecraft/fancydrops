# FancyDrops design requirements

Standing rules from the author (ImTra). Read this before changing the menu, animations or drop settings, and keep it up to date. When a change is made to one page, change every other page and button it affects (for example, if the Mythological Animations page is copied to Slayers, the Slayers buttons must describe the Slayers scenes).

## Working rules
- Short UI text. Releases are manual (the author runs the "Release FancyDrops" workflow with the version).
- Per update: bump `version=` in `gradle.properties`, add a `## x.y.z` section at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`, commit and push to `main`.
- Commit as `tra` (`git -c user.name=tra -c user.email=imtraminecraft@gmail.com commit`).
- Make a mockup first for anything visual and big, and wait for approval before building it.
- Nothing can be compiled or run in the cloud workspace. Say so honestly. Check for duplicate methods and variable names by hand.
- Icons must be hand-pixeled, centred in their 16x16 square, animated, and unique to the thing they show. They must not look AI-made.
- The mod is free, with Patreon supporters getting extra customisation later.

## Drop Library
- The "Show" filter has four buttons: **Enabled, Normal, RNG, Disabled**. Make it obvious these are the three animation states.
  - Enabled: anything with Normal on, RNG on, or Chat Alert on.
  - Normal: only items whose animation state is Normal.
  - RNG: only items whose animation state is RNG.
  - Disabled: items whose animation state is Disabled, or whose Chat Alert is off.
- Each item row has three controls: the **animation state** button (short name: Off / Normal / RNG), the **Chat Alert** toggle, and the **Preview** button.
- Choosing Normal turns Chat Alert OFF. Choosing RNG turns Chat Alert ON. The user can then toggle Chat Alert by hand.

## Animation states
- Disabled, Normal, RNG. A fourth scene (No Drops) exists but the user cannot pick it.
- **Normal** and **No Drops**: a short scene shown above the SkyBlock action bar. The hotbar, hearts and the rest of the HUD stay visible. 3 seconds by default.
- **RNG**: the big scene. Black bars come in and the whole HUD (hotbar and everything) is hidden. 5 seconds by default.
- The user can change each duration in the Animations tab. The maximum is **7 seconds**.
- The chat alert is sent first. The message stays hidden from the player until the animation has fully played.
- If the animation text is at the bottom and the scene position is at the bottom, the text must not be covered by the SkyBlock action bar. Move the scene up a little and draw the text over the scene (so the scene does not cover the middle of the screen).
- When animations change, re-check every text and position setting so none is left broken.

## Animations tab
- The "Changes" buttons (black bars, animation text, item changes) sit at the very top.
- The Animation scenes page stays as it is. Length maximum is 7 seconds.

## Sounds
- The sound system stays. The sound waves are redrawn so they look clean.

## Chat
- The Message format editor is visible without scrolling. Previews live outside the main menu panel.

## Mythological Rituals (first finished category; Slayers, Dye, Farming, Experiments, Mining and Fishing follow)
- Mythological opens a hub with two sub pages:
  - **Mythological Mobs**: the creatures, and the Griffin Pet picker.
  - **Treasure**: the spade picker, the Erudite reforge and the treasure drops with their chances.
- Redo all icons for Mythological, and make sure each one is correct.
- Redo the Mythological scenes. Mobs keep the lightning idea. Treasure shows someone digging with a shovel until the treasure is found. As cool as possible within the rules above.
- Categories that are not finished keep the "Coming Soon" construction-site page (hazard tape, hard hats, crane, bulldozer). The author wants it kept but tidy: fixed layout on one ground line, few props, nothing overlapping, nothing interactive. (A crane-builds-then-explodes scene was an earlier idea; the author later said to keep this page.)
